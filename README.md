Here’s how the flow would work for the Interview Simulation page based on your description:

### **Wireframe for Interview Simulation Flow**

1. **Home Page**:
   - **User Logged In**:
     - After successful login, the user sees a dashboard with a **Get Started** button.
     - **Get Started Button**: When clicked, it leads to the Interview Simulation Page.

2. **Interview Simulation Page**:
   - **Job Title Input**:
     - The user is asked to input their desired **Job Title** (e.g., Software Engineer, Marketing Manager).
     - **Text input field** with a placeholder: "Enter Job Title"
   
   - **Job Description Input**:
     - Below the Job Title input, the user is prompted to input the **Job Description** (a brief summary of the job's key responsibilities).
     - **Text input field** with a placeholder: "Enter Job Description"
   
   - **Next Button**:
     - After filling in both fields, the user clicks the **Next** button, which triggers the AI interview process.
     - **Submit** button: When clicked, it sends the inputs to the backend for processing.

3. **AI Interview Simulation**:
   - **Question Generation**:
     - The system processes the job title and description through the predefined NLP models and generates a list of questions that are relevant to the job role.
     - These questions could be asked one at a time or shown as a batch for the user to choose from.
     - **AI generates the questions** based on the job title and description input by the user. It uses predefined models trained on interview question datasets.

4. **User Response Recording**:
   - The user responds to each question, either through text input or voice (if speech analysis is involved).
   - There should be a **Recording Button** to start and stop voice responses for speech analysis, or an option for **typed text** input for the answers.
   
   - **Real-time Evaluation**: 
     - The system uses machine learning to evaluate the responses in real time, assessing both **content** (for relevance to the job) and **delivery** (such as tone, clarity, etc.).
     - **Facial Expression and Speech Pattern Analysis**: Using the webcam and microphone, the system evaluates the user’s facial expressions and speech patterns.

5. **Feedback**:
   - After completing the simulation, the user receives feedback on:
     - **Content Quality**: How relevant the answers were to the job.
     - **Structure of Responses**: Was the response well-organized?
     - **Delivery**: Analysis of tone, clarity, and facial expressions.
   - **Detailed Performance Review**: The user gets a score or a detailed summary of strengths and areas for improvement.
   
6. **Optional Actions**:
   - **Retake Simulation**: User can retake the simulation based on feedback.
   - **Save Responses**: Option to save the session for future reference.

### **Example Flow of Pages:**

1. **Home Page (after login)**:
   - `Welcome back, [User Name]`
   - [Get Started Button]

2. **Interview Simulation Page**:
   - `Enter Job Title`: [Text Input]
   - `Enter Job Description`: [Text Input]
   - [Next Button]

3. **AI Interview Simulation**:
   - Question 1: [Question Text]
   - User Answer: [Text Input/Voice Recording]
   - Question 2: [Question Text]
   - User Answer: [Text Input/Voice Recording]
   - [Submit Interview] (to process responses)

4. **Feedback Page**:
   - `Performance Summary`
   - Content Feedback: [Text or Visual Feedback]
   - Delivery Feedback: [Text or Visual Feedback]

### **Cloud Integration**:
- The system processes and stores the questions, responses, and evaluations in a cloud-based database for scalability and real-time processing.

Let me know if you would like to refine or add more elements to this wireframe!
Frontend: On the AI Interview page, once the user inputs their job title and description, you send these to the backend to generate interview questions using GPT.
Backend: The backend uses GPT-3 (or GPT-4) to generate the questions and returns them to the frontend.
User Answers: The user responds to the questions, and those responses are sent to the backend.
Backend: The backend uses BERT (or GPT) to evaluate the user's response.
Frontend: The evaluation score or feedback is displayed to the user
